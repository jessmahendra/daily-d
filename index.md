when in doubt...bake a cake.
(Not in excess, because we don't like it when people stockpile and buy too much stuff).

Let's bake a carrot cake! And let's also make this very clear - I did not come up with the recipe myself. I am, at best, a mediocre baker. The original recipe can be found here.
Here are the things you need:
Cake:
- 350g self-raising flour
- 325g dark soft brown sugar
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 250g carrots
- 75g walnuts
- 4 medium eggs
- 200ml olive oil
- 4 tbs milk
Frosting:
- 180g full fat cream cheese
- 30g icing sugar
- 25g walnuts

Here's what you need to do:
Steps steps steps

Enjoy!
