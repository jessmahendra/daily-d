so like I mentioned in the previous post, I've been trying to experiment a little bit in the kitchen. Something about being stuck at home I believe.. makes you explore every inch and corner of your house and discover new ways to stay busy and entertained.

The other night, having just come back from a run (how cool is it that I can say this now?! I feel like I've levelled up or something), naturally I was starving. The original plan was to make this quick lemon pepper chicken recipe - which has been tried and tested. But alas, there was no chicken in the fridge.

It did involve some frantic dig down the internet hole to figure out what to cook for dinner. I needed something tasty, something quick, and something which didn't involve too many complicated ingredients. It was a battle between chickpeas or lentils.. but in the end, lentils won out. Mostly because the recipe I was using had eggs in it, and that we didn't have enough chickpeas.

I based it on this [recipe](https://www.olivemagazine.com/recipes/vegetarian/spiced-crispy-egg-and-lentil-curry/). It ticked all the boxes, except for the 'quick' one. Definitely wasn't the quickest to make - it took 30 minutes just to let the curry simmer. I'd say it took about an hour total - but it was so worth it. Very tasty, and not a lot of complicated ingredients involved!

Here's what you need:

Curry:
red lentils 100g
onions 2, roughly chopped
chopped tomatoes 400g tin
ground turmeric 1 tsp
oil 2 tbsp, for frying
ground cumin 1 Â½ tsp
ground coriander 1 Â½ tsp
cardamom pods 4, squashed
root ginger a thumb-sized piece, finely chopped
garlic 4 cloves, crushed
green chillies 2-3, sliced
baby spinach 100g, chopped
garam masala 1 tsp
coriander a small bunch, chopped
steamed basmati rice or chapatis to serve

For the crispy eggs you'll need:
eggs 6
ground turmeric Â¼ tsp
paprika Â¼ tsp

Here's how to do it:
1. Put the lentils, onions and tomatoes in a pan with the turmeric and 1 tsp salt. Add water to just cover, then simmer gently for 20 minutes until the lentils are tender
2. Drop the eggs into boiling water, cook for 7 minutes then plunge into iced water and leave until cooled.
3. Heat half the oil in a pan then stir in the cumin, coriander and cardamom. Cook for 2 minutes then stir in the ginger, garlic and chillies. Cook for a few minutes then add the lentil mixture and 100ml water. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Add the spinach and cook for another 10 minutes.
4. Peel the eggs and heat the remaining oil in a frying pan. Add the eggs, turmeric and paprika, then season with salt and cook until the skin starts to blister and crisp up.
5. Stir the garam masala and coriander into the curry and serve with the halved eggs and rice or chapatis.

We didn't have coriander unfortunately, but I think it would have tasted spectacular with coriander. 

So if you're looking for an easy recipe, have a go at this and let me know how it goes!

Good luck ðŸ˜Š
