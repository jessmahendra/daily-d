i wasn't sure how this one would turn out. I am not a painter, not the most naturally artistic person in the world. When it comes to art, the best thing I got going for me is probably calligraphy/lettering - even then I'm not exactly good at drawing letters.

But never mind! Who says you have to be naturally gifted to paint. Honestly, I thought it would just really fun to just play with colours, splatter some acrylic paint around. So that's exactly what I did. One thing about this though - art supplies are not exactly cheap. Things do add up: brushes, acrylic paint, canvas.. Luckily, we already had brushes and acrylic paint in the house. No canvas though, so we decided to make do with wood. Wood? Yes. Inspired by [Marc Hemeon](https://www.marchemeon.com/) and his beautiful paintings, I picked up some wood that just happened to be there lying around... and painted on it. And it worked! It had a nice smooth surface, so it was relatively easy to work with. I spent the next hour or so making a complete mess and having lots of fun.

I don't know about you, but sometimes painting, drawing, and all these' artsy' things can be quite daunting especially if you're new to it, and you're not naturally gifted. But I think this is the perfect time to just experiment. The aim is not to impress anyone, it's just to have fun and have a creative outlet. Some of you might find it helpful, especially during this weird situation where many of us might have a lot of pent-up frustration.

So today's idea isn't super complicated. Grab some paints, brushes, and some type of flat surface, and paint away!

Have fun ðŸ˜Š
