board games are so underrated. Not when you're a kid, I suppose. I have so many fond memories of playing Checkers, Monopoly, and Scrabble as a kid. An important side note here though, is that smartphones weren't really a thing when I was growing up, so distractions like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok didn't exist (not that I'm on TikTok now, I'm not _that_ cool).

One nice thing about the lockdown is that as we all rack our brains to find new ways to keep ourselves entertained, lots of things that seem to be a distant memory are now resurfacing. (Also, who else is finding themselves experimenting a bit more in the kitchen? I made a lentil curry the other night and I must say, I was very proud of the result).

If you think back to your childhood, what were the things you used to do to keep you busy? I remember many evenings of playing board games. I gotta say though, my family wasn't the most adventurous when it comes to board games. Or is my memory failing me? The ones that stick out the most are Monopoly, Scrabble, and Checkers. So I definitely did not know how to play Backgammon.

That is, until a few nights ago! Oh yes, how exciting. Instead of a normal dinner then TV or dinner then chat routine, this night we opted for... a backgammon session.

It was difficult. It was so much trickier than it looked! I mean I did still win the first game üòè Hahaha jokes - I only won because I was basically told what moves to make, and for some reason, the dice seemed to be on my side. Not as much luck the second time around, I'm afraid - proof to you that it was all due to a) beginner's luck, and b) external help. But hey, at least now I know how to play Backgammon! Kind of.

So maybe for today's idea, we can try play some board games! The internet is fun and all, but I guess it can be good to take an hour or so off the internet and have an offline entertainment. Go back to your childhood, and explore those things you used to love doing as a kid.

I'm sure a little reminiscing won't hurt! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
