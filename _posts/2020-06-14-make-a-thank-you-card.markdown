i think by now we all have come to realise how important human connection is. This whole not being able to see friends and family really expresses 'you don't appreciate what you have until you lose it' perfectly.

It's also really interesting to see how lockdown has also strengthened some friendships and relationships - it feels like we are now making more of a deliberate effort to connect with each other and to check in on each other.

Thinking about it from that perspective kind of warms my heart a little bit (as warm as it can be right now - the hanger is really kicking in). Yesterday during a meeting we were asked who made us happy during lockdown, which I thought was a very nice sentiment. And that gave me an idea - wouldn't it be nice to actually express that thank you to the people who have made our lives happier and easier during lockdown?

I need to start doing this more. Often I just think these things and don't actually end up doing them. When I was asked that question, I immediately thought about my parents who have been sending selfies and videos (one of which was a video of my dad shaving his head. Lol). I really should get better at replying texts.

So today's idea: make a thank you card! Honestly, it doesn't even have to be fancy for whoever's getting it to appreciate it. As they say, it's the thought that counts (though it also doesn't mean that you shouldn't make an effort. Sorry, double negatives. It means that you still should make an effort if possible ðŸ˜Š).

One last thing before I go - thank you dear reader! Whoever you are, wherever you are. Thanks for reading my disorganised thoughts, my (often un-)structured mess ðŸ˜Š
