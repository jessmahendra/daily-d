one good thing about being in lockdown is that you can go for a run and dance outside (for a good while) before you see another person.

If I think about the lockdown too much, my head starts to hurt and freak out about not knowing when all this will end. So I find that it's best to distract myself by keeping busy and staying active. If you've read my second newsletter then you'll know that I've decided to make running a regular thing in my life (if you're not subscribed and don't know what I'm talking about, you can read that [here](https://mailchi.mp/f8ad3e47f422/newsletter-2-i-went-for-a-run). You can sign up for the newsletter below for some reading materials for when you're bored and have nothing better to do). That's exactly what I did last Saturday, I went for a run.

I can't say that I enjoyed every single second of that run, but I do have to admit that the post-run feeling was great. I was pretty proud of myself for having completed the first task of the Couch to 5K programme, and maybe it was a combination of that and the warm weather, and [the song I was listening to](https://open.spotify.com/track/47w6S27JF4Zvrz1Wd6R66Z?si=LBy15BVbTh-yQ4fhkYTI5g), but I kind of felt this weird need to just start dancing around in the middle of nowhere (where nobody could see me, because I still have a sense of pride).

So I did. Then I realised how much I'd missed dancing.
