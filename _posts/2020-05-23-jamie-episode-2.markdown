**what did you do today?**
<br>
Went for a walk to the park early morning and bumped into my year 7 maths teacher and her dog. Had a nice chat, then came back to speak to a friend on Zoom, before having two bacon and egg bagels for lunch. Then went for a long walk in the forest, bought some haribo and a pot noodle as a throwback to being a 12 year old kid, ate them outside in the garden, followed by a hot bath. 

**Did you think about something or someone you hadn't in a while?**
<br>
Everything I used to do as a kid on summer holidays around this area - including my paper round and the man who ran it. He looked (looks?) suspiciously like Fagin.

**Did you have a meaningful interaction with someone?**
<br>
My old maths teacher - was sad to hear that unfortunately she's got cancer, but is still running (which is her favourite sport) and was great to see how excited she was to see what I was up to now. Also funny she didn't recognise me at all despite the fact I probably haven't grown since then either.

**Did anything interesting happen?**
<br>
Got sent these journal prompts.

**Did you learn something new about yourself?**
<br>
I love fresh turmeric - gives me loads of energy. 

**How do you feel about lockdown today?**
<br>
I felt good. It's been quite chilled compared to normal London life, but would like to see friends properly!

**Additional comments**
<br>
Found out the Bourne Stores don't sell Refreshers any more. This thoroughly disappointed my inner child.
