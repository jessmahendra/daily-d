do a big what? What is a brain dump? This is something completely inspired by The Artist's Way. I've always liked the idea of journalling to keep a log of your thoughts, goals, and dreams so they're no longer just thoughts floating about in your head. Writing things down makes them real, and the more real they are, the more likely I am to act on them.

I think it's mostly because writing them down in a way feels like a commitment device. This isn't always the case - sometimes you write things down just because you want to get them out of your head and you don't want to forget things. But when it comes to goals and dreams and all that kind of stuff, I think writing them down - and the more specific the better - feels like you're making a commitment to yourself, and you're more likely to stick to it as a result.

But that's not what this post is really about. The purpose of this big brain dump is just to write down whatever you're thinking of - it can be as silly or as heavy as you'd like it to be. The idea is just to declutter your brain, and this is one of the main tools that Julia Cameron, the author of The Artist's Way, swears by. To get to the other side, you have to break the barrier that is often self-made, intentionally or unintentionally.

She calls it longhand, stream-of-consciousness morning writing, and you're not supposed to reread it for a while. You can have check-ins every now and then, to give you a journal to your creative journey. I don't know, I'm just very intrigued. I feel like I've written about this so many times now, but I'll do it again one more time. Just in case.

I first heard about this from Tim Ferriss's podcast with Elizabeth Gilbert. On the podcast, she talked about how her morning pages led to a discovery that she wanted to learn Italian, something that she'd never known about herself before. It just revealed itself in her morning brain dumps. And it led to a big around-the-world self-discovery journey. That's how Eat, Pray, Love came about.

That's what really piqued my interest. We think we know ourselves, but how well? How often do we have thoughts that barely make it to our consciousness, that we miss them? Also I'd like to think that getting out silly, sometimes unnecessary thoughts first thing in the morning might help me organise my thoughts a lot better during the day. And if it works for Elizabeth Gilbert and so many others, think there's a pretty high probability that it would work for me too.

I don't know, I'm going to give it a go and see what it does to my brain. Have a go, you might find it helpful too!

Good luck!
