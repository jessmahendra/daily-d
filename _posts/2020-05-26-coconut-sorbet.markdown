ever wanted to make your own ice cream? I certainly have, but have always been daunted by expensive churning machines or complicated recipes. This sorbet recipe provides a simple and unique tasting alternative. You won’t have tasted anything like it before.

One of the best things about it is that it’s the perfect pantry recipe, containing only a handful of ingredients (that you may already have). 

Here’s what you’ll need:

- 2 cans of coconut milk 
- 400ml of honey 
- Limes 
- Sea Salt

How to make:

1. Using a blender or food processor, give the coconut milk and honey a quick whiz.
2. Mix in sea salt and the juice of one lime. Pour into a plastic tub and put in the freezer. 
3. Every hour or so take a fork and give the sorbet a good mix, scraping through any ice crystals that form. It’s best to do this over the course of 3-4 hours and then leave overnight until solid. 

Garnish as much lime zest and sea salt as you like.  

It’s really that simple.
