**what did you do today?**
<br>
Finished one book and started another. The one I put down was Michael Pollan’s ‘How to change your mind’ - a deep dive into the often misunderstood world of psychedelics. Pollan is an immersive journalist, type of writer who while writing a book about architecture builds his own house and when writing a book about food lives with his own cows for a year. You can probably imagine what he does in preparation for his latest book. The latter chapters about psychedelic treatment to addiction and depression are particularly interesting. 

The book I picked up is ‘Dark lies the island’ by Irish writer Kevin Barry. The back of the book promises me a collection of short stories about: disco at the end of the world, a teenage goth on a terror mission, scouse real-ale enthusiasts, and occult weirdness in the woods. I’m only one story one but so good so far. 

**Did you think about something or someone you hadn’t in a while?**
<br>
A friend of mine who I haven’t seen in years. They would always announce (refreshingly) how much they didn’t know. That they were by no means an expert in anything. That they’d struggle to even pick a ‘mastermind topic’. Wise words, especially in a time when we are suddenly experts in epidemiology, the economy, and behavioural fatigue. 

**Did you have a meaningful interaction with someone (or was it just meaningless zoom faff)?**
<br>
I’ve been Netflix partying (watching films with friends online), which usually ends up being a chaotic yet fun mess. Meaningful? Probably not but I wouldn’t say completely meaningless. 

**Did anything interesting happen?**
<br>
The sun in Ireland continued to shine. This amount of good weather is highly abnormal. More suspicious than anything else. 

**Did you learn something new about yourself?**
<br>
I find I don’t miss the pub as much as I thought I would. There seems little point to getting pissed over zoom. This feels like the easiest time I’ll ever have to not drink in excess - so therefore I haven’t.

**How do you feel about lockdown today?**
<br>
I feel future-oriented. It’s a nice form of present-escapism. People have started to talk about after - what they’ll do when everything finally settles down. And I don’t blame them - it seems like an eternity. It feels so long ago that the virus was a small afterthought of a news item, hidden away behind articles on Brexit, the US election and the Premier League. It feels a long time ago that I casually dismissed the outbreak in China with “well, that would never happen here”. Now I’ve allowed my mind to wander back to a covid-free world. Planning future holidays in my head being the funnest of these mental activities - a 5 day road-trip around the Scottish Highlands? Yes please!
