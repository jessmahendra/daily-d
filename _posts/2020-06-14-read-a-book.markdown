when i was brainstorming on what new Daily Diversions idea I could write about, I was slightly surprised that I hadn't thought of this. Of course. Read a book!

At the beginning of lockdown when we were all scrambling for ideas on what to do, read more books (or read *a* book), was one of the things that made it on the post-its. Just before lockdown, things were getting really busy at work and finishing the book I was reading at the time became a bit of a struggle. Dinner time was slowly merging with Netflix time.. and the 'read-before-bed' ritual slowly phased out and was replaced by - you guessed it - my relentless Netflix habit. More screen time. Lower quality of sleep. Not good.

Now I'm starting to feel a bit guilty about watching Netflix all the time, or at least, more than two hours at a time. I suppose now that I'm home all the time, the pleasure of switching off by putting on an easy-to-watch series on Netflix isn't felt as much.

Today's idea is pretty simple I guess. Grab a book and read it. And finish it, for goodness sake! I'm going to try to finally finish Enlightenment Now by Steven Pinker.

That's a good book to read. Here's a short list for you if you're looking for some inspiration:

1. **Enlightenment Now** by Steven Pinker - I just mentioned it, but this is a brilliant book which depicts how we often rely on our mental shortcuts and we miss the fact that the world is, believe it or not, the most safe now than it's ever been. Ever.
2. **The Obstacle Is the Way** by Ryan Holiday - he is a proponent of Stoicism and I'm trying to learn more about it. I read this book a couple of years ago and I loved everything about it. It teaches you to be more reflective and look at things in a new perspective.
3. **Mastery** by Robert Greene - this book left such an impression on me. I finished this book on my flight back home a few years ago (it was a 16 hour flight). I just could not put it down. In this book, you'll find inspiring stories of people who achieved and accomplished so much, all because they were masters in their respective fields.

If you have any other book recommendations, please do send them my way! I'd be interested to know what you and other people are reading.

Ok let's put down our devices and read some books!
