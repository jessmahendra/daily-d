when in doubt...bake a cake.
(Not in excess, because we don't like it when people stockpile and buy too much stuff).

Let's bake a carrot cake! And let's also make this very clear - I did not come up with the recipe myself. I am, at best, a mediocre baker. If you're like me (i.e. bored, wanting to find things to do and experiment a little bit because you're bored), then this might be fun! The original recipe can be found <a href="https://www.easypeasyfoodie.com/super-simple-carrot-cake/" target="_blank">here</a>.

Here are the things you need:

Cake:

- 350g self-raising flour
- 325g dark soft brown sugar
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 250g carrots
- 75g walnuts
- 4 medium eggs
- 200ml olive oil
- 4 tbs milk

Frosting:

- 180g full fat cream cheese
- 30g icing sugar
- 25g walnuts

Here's what you need to do:

1. Preheat the oven to 160C. Grease and line the bottom and sides of a 22cm round cake tin with a double layer of greaseproof paper.
2. Mix together the flour, sugar, cinnamon, roughly chopped walnuts and grated carrots in a large bowl.
3. Beat together the eggs, olive oil and milk in a large jug.
4. Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients slowly, stirring to make sure all the flour is incorporated.
5. Tip the cake mixture into the lined cake tin and cook for 1h15, or until a skewer (or a fork) comes out clean.

For the (optional) frosting, simply:

Mix the cream cheese and icing sugar together and spread it on the top of the cake. Sprinkle the finely chopped walnuts on the top.

Enjoy!
