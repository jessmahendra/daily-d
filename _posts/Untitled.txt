so like I mentioned in the previous post, I've been trying to experiment a little bit in the kitchen. Something about being stuck at home I believe.. makes you explore every inch and corner of your house and discover new ways to stay busy and entertained.

The other night, having just come back from a run (how cool is it that I can say this now?! I feel like I've levelled up or something), naturally I was starving. The original plan was to make this quick lemon pepper chicken recipe - which has been tried and tested. But alas, there was no chicken in the fridge.

It did involve some frantic dig down the internet hole to figure out what to cook for dinner. I needed something tasty, something quick, and something which didn't involve too many complicated ingredients. It was a battle between chickpeas or lentils.. but in the end, lentils won out.
