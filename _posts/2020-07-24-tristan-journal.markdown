**what did you do today?**
<br>
I worked from home (nothing exciting there) and then I spent a few hours at the basketball courts, doing some drills and taking a bunch of shots.

**Did you think about something or someone you hadn't in a while?**
<br>
When I was playing basketball, I thought back to the old days when I would play in Dulwich Park with my cousins and brother on the weekends in summer.

**Did you have a meaningful interaction with someone (or was it just meaningless zoom faff)?**
<br>
I had a conversation with a friend of mine who needed advice on a personal issue. I think after the first 6 weeks of quarantine, Zoom/House Party faff evaporated from the zeitgeist.

**Did anything interesting happen?**
<br>
Seinfeld Season 4 happened. I have started a run of classic modern sitcoms and I would definitely recommend Seinfeld, if not for the show then for the theme song alone.

**Did you learn something new about yourself?**
<br>
I learnt that my productivity and motivation is mostly dependent on whether I get a good night's sleep.

**How do you feel about lockdown today?**
<br>
I feel good about lockdown. It was initially tough but I think it became a very constructive time for introspection.

**Additional comments?**
Try something new!
