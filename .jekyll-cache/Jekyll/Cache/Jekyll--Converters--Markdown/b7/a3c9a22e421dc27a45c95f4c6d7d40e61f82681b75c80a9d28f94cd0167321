I"I<p><strong>what did you do today?</strong>
<br />
I started my day off with a run, did some meditation, had to do some work, did my laundry, cleaned up the flat and that’s pretty much it for now! I think I’ve been more productive than I ever have in my life because of lockdown so I’m feeling pretty good about things.</p>
