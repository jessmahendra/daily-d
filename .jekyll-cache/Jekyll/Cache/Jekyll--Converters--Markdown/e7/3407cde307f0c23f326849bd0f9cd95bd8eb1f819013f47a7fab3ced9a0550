I"F<p>ever wanted to make your own ice cream? I certainly have, but have always been daunted by expensive churning machines or complicated recipes. This sorbet recipe provides a simple and unique tasting alternative. You won’t have tasted anything like it before.</p>

<p>One of the best things about it is that it’s the perfect pantry recipe, containing only a handful of ingredients (that you may already have).</p>

<p>Here’s what you’ll need:</p>

<ul>
  <li>2 cans of coconut milk</li>
  <li>400ml of honey</li>
  <li>Limes</li>
  <li>Sea Salt</li>
</ul>

<p>How to make:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Using a blender or food processor, give the coconut milk and honey a quick whiz.</li>
  <li>Mix in sea salt and the juice of one lime. Pour into a plastic tub and put in the freezer.</li>
  <li>Every hour or so take a fork and give the sorbet a good mix, scraping through any ice crystals that form. It’s best to do this over the course of 3-4 hours and then leave overnight until solid.</li>
</ol>

<p>Garnish as much lime zest and sea salt as you like.</p>

<p>It’s really that simple.</p>
