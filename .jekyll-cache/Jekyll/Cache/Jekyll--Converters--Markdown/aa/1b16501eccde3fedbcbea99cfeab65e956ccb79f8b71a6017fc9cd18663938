I"<p>the world of podcasts is wonderful. Iâ€™m someone who has always enjoyed listening to the radio. Hearing stories and conversations on the radio has always felt like a treat - getting to know how other people think, talk, and see the world. Not just that though. Thereâ€™s something about voices that I find just so relaxing and soothing (some more than others, perhaps. My top two favourite voices: <a href="https://99percentinvisible.org/">Roman Mars</a> &amp; <a href="https://onbeing.org/">Krista Tippett</a>. Youâ€™re welcome).</p>
