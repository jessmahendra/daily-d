I"ô<p>ever wanted to make your own ice cream? I certainly have, but have always been daunted by expensive churning machines or complicated recipes. This sorbet recipe provides a simple and unique tasting alternative. You wonâ€™t have tasted anything like it before.</p>

<p>One of the best things about it is that itâ€™s the perfect pantry recipe, containing only a handful of ingredients (that you may already have).</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll need:</p>

<p>2 cans of coconut milk 
400ml of honey 
Limes 
Sea Salt</p>

<p>How to make:</p>

<p>Using a blender or food processor, give the coconut milk and honey a quick whiz. Mix in sea salt and the juice of one lime. Pour into a plastic tub and put in the freezer. Every hour or so take a fork and give the sorbet a good mix, scraping through any ice crystals that form. Itâ€™s best to do this over the course of 3-4 hours and then leave overnight until solid.</p>

<p>Garnish as much lime zest and sea salt as you like.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s really that simple.</p>
