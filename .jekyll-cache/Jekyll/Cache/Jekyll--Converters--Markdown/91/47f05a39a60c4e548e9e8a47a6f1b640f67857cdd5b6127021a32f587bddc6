I"o<p>do a big what? What is a brain dump? This is something completely inspired by The Artist’s Way. I’ve always liked the idea of journalling to keep a log of your thoughts, goals, and dreams so they’re no longer just thoughts floating about in your head. Writing things down makes them real, and the more real they are, the more likely I am to act on them.</p>
