I"u<p><strong>What did you do today?</strong>
<br />
Went for a walk to the park early morning and bumped into my year 7 maths teacher and her dog. Had a nice chat, then came back to speak to a friend on Zoom, before having two bacon and egg bagels for lunch. Then went for a long walk in the forest, bought some haribo and a pot noodle as a throwback to being a 12 year old kid, ate them outside in the garden, followed by a hot bath.</p>

<p><strong>Did you think about something or someone you hadn’t in a while?</strong>
<br />
Everything I used to do as a kid on summer holidays around this area - including my paper round and the man who ran it. He looked (looks?) suspiciously like Fagin.</p>

<p><strong>Did you have a meaningful interaction with someone?</strong>
<br />
My old maths teacher - was sad to hear that unfortunately she’s got cancer, but is still running (which is her favourite sport) and was great to see how excited she was to see what I was up to now. Also funny she didn’t recognise me at all despite the fact I probably haven’t grown since then either.</p>

<p><strong>Did anything interesting happen?</strong>
<br />
Got sent these journal prompts.</p>

<p><strong>Did you learn something new about yourself?</strong>
<br />
I love fresh turmeric - gives me loads of energy.</p>

<p><strong>How do you feel about lockdown today?</strong>
<br />
I felt good. It’s been quite chilled compared to normal London life, but would like to see friends properly!</p>

Found out the Bourne Stores don’t sell Refreshers any more. This thoroughly disappointed my inner child.</p>
