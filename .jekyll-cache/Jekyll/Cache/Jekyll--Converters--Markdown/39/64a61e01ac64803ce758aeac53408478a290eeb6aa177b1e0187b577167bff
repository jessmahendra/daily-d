I"Š<p>when in doubtâ€¦bake a cake.
(Not in excess, because we donâ€™t like it when people stockpile and buy too much stuff).</p>

<p>Letâ€™s bake a carrot cake! And letâ€™s also make this very clear - I did not come up with the recipe myself. I am, at best, a mediocre baker. The original recipe can be found <a href="https://www.easypeasyfoodie.com/super-simple-carrot-cake/">here</a>.</p>

<p>Here are the things you need:</p>

<p>Cake:</p>

<ul>
  <li>350g self-raising flour</li>
  <li>325g dark soft brown sugar</li>
  <li>1 tsp cinnamon</li>
  <li>250g carrots</li>
  <li>75g walnuts</li>
  <li>4 medium eggs</li>
  <li>200ml olive oil</li>
  <li>4 tbs milk</li>
</ul>

<p>Frosting:</p>

<ul>
  <li>180g full fat cream cheese</li>
  <li>30g icing sugar</li>
  <li>25g walnuts</li>
</ul>

<p>Hereâ€™s what you need to do:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Preheat the oven to 160C. Grease and line the bottom and sides of a 22cm round cake tin with a double layer of greaseproof paper.</li>
  <li>Mix together the flour, sugar, cinnamon, roughly chopped walnuts and grated carrots in a large bowl.</li>
  <li>Beat together the eggs, olive oil and milk in a large jug.</li>
  <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients slowly, stirring to make sure all the flour is incorporated.</li>
  <li>Tip the cake mixture into the lined cake tin and cook for 1h15, or until a skewer (or a fork) comes out clean.</li>
</ol>

<p>Enjoy!</p>
