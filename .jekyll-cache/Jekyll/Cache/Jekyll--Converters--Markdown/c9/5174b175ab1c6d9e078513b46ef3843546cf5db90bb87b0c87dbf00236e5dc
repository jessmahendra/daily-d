I"U<p><strong>what did you do today?</strong>
<br />
Finished one book and started another. The one I put down was Michael Pollan’s ‘How to change your mind’ - a deep dive into the often misunderstood world of psychedelics. Pollan is an immersive journalist, type of writer who while writing a book about architecture builds his own house and when writing a book about food lives with his own cows for a year. You can probably imagine what he does in preparation for his latest book. The latter chapters about psychedelic treatment to addiction and depression are particularly interesting.</p>
