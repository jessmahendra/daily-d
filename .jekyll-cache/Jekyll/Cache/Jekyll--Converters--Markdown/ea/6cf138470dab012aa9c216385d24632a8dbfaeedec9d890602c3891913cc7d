I"Æ<p>itâ€™s been just over a month now since the government told us to stay at home. I donâ€™t know about you, but I find it quite hard to find the perfect word to describe the sentiment of this situation, and to describe how I feel about it all. It feels like everything happened so suddenly, and escalated so quickly. The whole thing is so unprecedented that I feel I lack the framework to comprehend whatâ€™s going on now and what will happen next.</p>
