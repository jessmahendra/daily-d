I"þ<p>during lockdown I have jumped on the pickling and fermenting bandwagon. Fermenting, in particular, has become very fashionable in recent times aided somewhat by <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Noma-Guide-Fermentation-Foundations-Flavor/dp/1579657184">Noma</a> becoming a trendy thing to namedrop in conversation. Many people use the terms, pickling and fermenting, interchangeably yet there is a difference. Pickling involves putting food into an acidic brine to produce a sour flavour, while fermenting gives flavour without any added acid. Ferments have some serious health benefits. They are loaded with probiotics and can improve digestion. Pickles, on the other hand, arenâ€™t the healthiest of options. It doesnâ€™t stop them being delicious however.</p>
