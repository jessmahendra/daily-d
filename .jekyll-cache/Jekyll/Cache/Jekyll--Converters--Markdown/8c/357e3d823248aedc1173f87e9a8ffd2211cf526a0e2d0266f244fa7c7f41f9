I"F<p>some people are born creative. Naturally artsy. Others.. not so much. Growing up I always liked the idea of doing art, but just never had the talent to do that. But I thought drawing letters were fun.</p>

<p>There’s something about beautiful lettering and calligraphy that just feels so satisfying and makes me happy. Because I’ve never been technical about it (because I lack the skills to do so), I thought that doing an online lettering class would be a great way to change that.</p>

<p>I’ve done a couple of Skillshare classes before on calligraphy and lettering, but it’s been a while and I feel like it’s one of those things where if you don’t practice regularly, you start to forget and become rusty. So now that I’m on furlough… it feels like the perfect time to take online lettering and calligraphy classes again!</p>

<p>Skillshare is a paid service, but like everyone else at this time, they are offering a free trial (so people like us can milk these services as much as we can).</p>

<p>So here are the two classes I’m doing:</p>

<ol>
  <li><strong>Seb Lester’s Calligraphy Course</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Jessica Hische’s Drop Cap Course</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>I will assure you that I won’t be able to finish these classes in a day, but that’s good - staying busy is what we want at this time!</p>
