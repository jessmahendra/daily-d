I"ü<p>so like I mentioned in the previous post, Iâ€™ve been trying to experiment a little bit in the kitchen. Something about being stuck at home I believe.. makes you explore every inch and corner of your house and discover new ways to stay busy and entertained.</p>

<p>The other night, having just come back from a run (how cool is it that I can say this now?! I feel like Iâ€™ve levelled up or something), naturally I was starving. The original plan was to make this quick lemon pepper chicken recipe - which has been tried and tested. But alas, there was no chicken in the fridge.</p>

<p>It did involve some frantic dig down the internet hole to figure out what to cook for dinner. I needed something tasty, something quick, and something which didnâ€™t involve too many complicated ingredients. It was a battle between chickpeas or lentils.. but in the end, lentils won out. Mostly because the recipe I was using had eggs in it, and that we didnâ€™t have enough chickpeas.</p>

<p>I based it on this <a href="https://www.olivemagazine.com/recipes/vegetarian/spiced-crispy-egg-and-lentil-curry/">recipe</a>. It ticked all the boxes, except for the â€˜quickâ€™ one. Definitely wasnâ€™t the quickest to make - it took 30 minutes just to let the curry simmer. Iâ€™d say it took about an hour total - but it was so worth it. Very tasty, and not a lot of complicated ingredients involved!</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s what you need:</p>

<p>Curry:</p>
<ul>
  <li>red lentils 100g</li>
  <li>onions 2, roughly chopped</li>
  <li>chopped tomatoes 400g tin</li>
  <li>ground turmeric 1 tsp</li>
  <li>oil 2 tbsp, for frying</li>
  <li>ground cumin 1 Â½ tsp</li>
  <li>ground coriander 1 Â½ tsp</li>
  <li>cardamom pods 4, squashed</li>
  <li>root ginger a thumb-sized piece, finely chopped</li>
  <li>garlic 4 cloves, crushed</li>
  <li>green chillies 2-3, sliced</li>
  <li>baby spinach 100g, chopped</li>
  <li>garam masala 1 tsp</li>
  <li>coriander a small bunch, chopped</li>
  <li>steamed basmati rice or chapatis to serve</li>
</ul>

<p>For the crispy eggs youâ€™ll need:</p>
<ul>
  <li>eggs 6</li>
  <li>ground turmeric Â¼ tsp</li>
  <li>paprika Â¼ tsp</li>
</ul>

<p>Hereâ€™s how to do it:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Put the lentils, onions and tomatoes in a pan with the turmeric and 1 tsp salt. Add water to just cover, then simmer gently for 20 minutes until the lentils are tender</li>
  <li>Drop the eggs into boiling water, cook for 7 minutes then plunge into iced water and leave until cooled.</li>
  <li>Heat half the oil in a pan then stir in the cumin, coriander and cardamom. Cook for 2 minutes then stir in the ginger, garlic and chillies. Cook for a few minutes then add the lentil mixture and 100ml water. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Add the spinach and cook for another 10 minutes.</li>
  <li>Peel the eggs and heat the remaining oil in a frying pan. Add the eggs, turmeric and paprika, then season with salt and cook until the skin starts to blister and crisp up.</li>
  <li>Stir the garam masala and coriander into the curry and serve with the halved eggs and rice or chapatis.</li>
</ol>

<p>We didnâ€™t have coriander unfortunately, but I think it would have tasted spectacular with coriander.</p>

<p>So if youâ€™re looking for an easy recipe, have a go at this and let me know how it goes!</p>

<p>Good luck ðŸ˜Š</p>
