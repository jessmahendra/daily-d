I"†<p>board games are so underrated. Not when youâ€™re a kid, I suppose. I have so many fond memories of playing Checkers, Monopoly, and Scrabble as a kid. An important side note here though, is that smartphones werenâ€™t really a thing when I was growing up, so distractions like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok didnâ€™t exist (not that Iâ€™m on TikTok now, Iâ€™m not <em>that</em> cool).</p>
