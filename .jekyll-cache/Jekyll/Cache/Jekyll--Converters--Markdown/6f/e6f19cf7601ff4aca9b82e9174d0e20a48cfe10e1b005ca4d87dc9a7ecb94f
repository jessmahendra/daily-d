I"ş<p>todayâ€™s daily diversion is actually what brought this website to life! I have always been intrigued by coding and the tech world.  It feel very relevant too to the field Iâ€™m in, which is (behavioural) design - <em>I sense a post coming on what behavioural design is!</em> I feel like in the direction that weâ€™re heading in, it seems inevitable that technology will take over pretty much most things in our lives. So I guess instead of resisting it, might as well try to understand it.</p>

<p>I took my first baby step last year when I decided to buy an online web development course. It was very basic yet very helpful. It gave me the foundation I needed to work with. But as Iâ€™m sure you know, the way to learn things is by doing. And unfortunately, I didnâ€™t have any real project to work on. Everything I did was based off instructions given in the lectures, and as a result I wasnâ€™t really able to have a deeper understanding of how things worked. Not that I have a deep understanding of it now ğŸ˜…, but I suppose I can say that Iâ€™m more confident about it now than I was about a year ago.</p>

<p>And then life got busy and I slowly lost all my willpower to continue practicing to code. All kinds of excuses were made. It was easy to say â€œIâ€™m tired, I have no timeâ€. But now I feel like that doesnâ€™t apply anymore. When youâ€™re locked in the house and not allowed to go out, and all you have is time, I suppose itâ€™s the perfect time to do everything youâ€™ve always wanted to do. So I decided to do just that - give myself a project. Build a website! How? Learn to code.</p>

<p>Yes, I know that we have all these amazing platforms like Squarespace, Wix, and Weebly that help us create beautiful websites without having to know the first thing about coding. My <a href="www.jessmessdesign.com">Jessâ€™ Mess</a> website is built on Squarespace. Itâ€™s great! But I did want to challenge myself because, after all, I had to find a way to kill time (and not kill myself as a result of boredom).</p>

<p>So here is the end-product! If you wondered why this website was so simple and basic, well.. I guess this answers your question. I <em>had</em> to make it very basic and simple because Iâ€™m a complete novice. But itâ€™s so satisfying to see the site up and running!</p>

<p>If youâ€™re also wanting to learn to code, here are some good sources you might find useful:</p>

<ol>
  <li><a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">Codeacademy</a> - they are actually giving away free premium memberships for people who have been directly impacted by the Coronavirus e.g. people on furlough. I did this briefly after I did my first web development course.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.killervideostore.com/">Stefan Mischookâ€™s online course</a> - this is the course I did. I enjoyed doing this course, and at the end of every chapter he has a quiz to make sure you understand the concepts.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.coursera.org/search?query=coding&amp;">Coursera</a> - they also have some free courses on basic coding languages, in partnership with and delivered by top universities.</li>
</ol>

<p>If this is something youâ€™ve always wanted to do, why not do it now? These three sources are a great place to start.</p>

<p>Good luck!</p>
