I"Ë<p>i think by now we all have come to realise how important human connection is. This whole not being able to see friends and family really expresses â€˜you donâ€™t appreciate what you have until you lose itâ€™ perfectly.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s also really interesting to see how lockdown has also strengthened some friendships and relationships - it feels like we are now making more of a deliberate effort to connect with each other and to check in on each other.</p>

<p>Thinking about it from that perspective kind of warms my heart a little bit (as warm as it can be right now - the hanger is really kicking in). Yesterday during a meeting we were asked who made us happy during lockdown, which I thought was a very nice sentiment. And that gave me an idea - wouldnâ€™t it be nice to actually express that thank you to the people who have made our lives happier and easier during lockdown?</p>

<p>I need to start doing this more. Often I just think these things and donâ€™t actually end up doing them. When I was asked that question, I immediately thought about my parents who have been sending selfies and videos (one of which was a video of my dad shaving his head. Lol). I really should get better at replying texts.</p>

<p>So todayâ€™s idea: make a thank you card! Honestly, it doesnâ€™t even have to be fancy for whoeverâ€™s getting it to appreciate it. As they say, itâ€™s the thought that counts (though it also doesnâ€™t mean that you shouldnâ€™t make an effort. Sorry, double negatives. It means that you still should make an effort if possible ðŸ˜Š).</p>

<p>One last thing before I go - thank you dear reader! Whoever you are, wherever you are. Thanks for reading my disorganised thoughts, my (often un-)structured mess ðŸ˜Š</p>
