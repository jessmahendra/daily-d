I"½<p>in the age of selfies and Instagram, and high-resolution cameras on our phones, taking pictures doesnâ€™t sound like an activity we need reminding of. If anything, it feels like sometimes we forget to actually take a second to enjoy where we are, what weâ€™re doing, and who weâ€™re with. But I do wonder if thatâ€™s actually due to our obsession of impressing others, rather than a healthy desire to remember moments dear to our hearts.</p>
