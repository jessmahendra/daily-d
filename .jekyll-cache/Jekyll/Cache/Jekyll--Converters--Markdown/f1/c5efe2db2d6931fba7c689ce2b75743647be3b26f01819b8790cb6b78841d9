I"ò<p>todayâ€™s daily diversion is actually what brought this website to life! I have always been intrigued by coding and the tech world.  It feel very relevant too to the field Iâ€™m in, which is (behavioural) design - <em>I sense a post coming on what behavioural design is!</em> I feel like in the direction that weâ€™re heading in, it seems inevitable that technology will take over pretty much most things in our lives. So I guess instead of resisting it, might as well try to understand it.</p>
