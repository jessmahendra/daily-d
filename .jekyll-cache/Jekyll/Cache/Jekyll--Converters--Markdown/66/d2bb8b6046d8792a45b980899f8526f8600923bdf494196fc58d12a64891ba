I"™<p>i wasnâ€™t sure how this one would turn out. I am not a painter, not the most naturally artistic person in the world. When it comes to art, the best thing I got going for me is probably calligraphy/lettering - even then Iâ€™m not exactly good at drawing letters.</p>

<p>But never mind! Who says you have to be naturally gifted to paint. Honestly, I thought it would just really fun to just play with colours, splatter some acrylic paint around. So thatâ€™s exactly what I did. One thing about this though - art supplies are not exactly cheap. Things do add up: brushes, acrylic paint, canvas.. Luckily, we already had brushes and acrylic paint in the house. No canvas though, so we decided to make do with wood. Wood? Yes. Inspired by <a href="https://www.marchemeon.com/">Marc Hemeon</a> and his beautiful paintings, I picked up some wood that just happened to be there lying aroundâ€¦ and painted on it. And it worked! It had a nice smooth surface, so it was relatively easy to work with. I spent the next hour or so making a complete mess and having lots of fun.</p>

<p>I donâ€™t know about you, but sometimes painting, drawing, and all theseâ€™ artsyâ€™ things can be quite daunting especially if youâ€™re new to it, and youâ€™re not naturally gifted. But I think this is the perfect time to just experiment. The aim is not to impress anyone, itâ€™s just to have fun and have a creative outlet. Some of you might find it helpful, especially during this weird situation where many of us might have a lot of pent-up frustration.</p>

<p>So todayâ€™s idea isnâ€™t super complicated. Grab some paints, brushes, and some type of flat surface, and paint away!</p>

<p>Have fun ðŸ˜Š</p>
