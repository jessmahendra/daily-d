I"Â<p><strong>what did you do today?</strong>
<br />
Today is a work day. Iâ€™ve been brought back from furlough, and weâ€™re now doing 4 days a week. Itâ€™s been nice so far, we have a mix of busy days and not-so-busy days. Iâ€™d say itâ€™s a good balance. Thereâ€™s been lots of staring at the screen today, and preparing for a presentation. Also tried to do a bit of writing and journalling (to officially launch this lockdown journal project!).</p>
