I"ö	<p><strong>what did you do today?</strong>
<br />
I started my day off with a run, did some meditation, had to do some work, did my laundry, cleaned up the flat and thatâ€™s pretty much it for now! I think Iâ€™ve been more productive than I ever have in my life because of lockdown so Iâ€™m feeling pretty good about things.</p>

<p><strong>Did you think about something or someone you hadnâ€™t in a while?</strong>
<br />
Not really, just focusing on the present :)</p>

<p><strong>Did you have a meaningful interaction with someone (or was it just meaningless zoom faff)?</strong>
<br />
Nope!</p>

<p><strong>Did anything interesting happen?</strong>
<br />
Nothing out of the ordinary, just a normal day.</p>

<p><strong>Did you learn something new about yourself?</strong>
<br />
I think Iâ€™m less scared of spiders now after having sucked up two spiders using a vacuum during lockdown so far. I hope they donâ€™t crawl back out haha.</p>

<p><strong>How do you feel about lockdown today?</strong>
<br />
Honestly I feel pretty good about lockdown right now. I found it quite difficult at the beginning and really let myself go. But once I started attending these daily meditation sessions hosted by my friend Ique, I feel itâ€™s really influenced my life in a positive way, where Iâ€™m slowly doing things to make my life better - like just this week Iâ€™ve started running after having not exercised in years and it feels really good :)</p>

<p>In the past Iâ€™ve always characterised myself as lazy in an ironic way. Like I would always joke about how exercise isnâ€™t really for me, that waking up early wasnâ€™t really my thing, etc. I think in a way I used humour as a way to justify or to deflect the negative parts of being lazy. But I think lockdown has really exacerbated those habits and made me realise the not so funny bits that come with being lazy. Physically, I felt that I had gained a lot of weight and felt quite weak and tired during the day, and mentally it made me feel really negatively towards myself.</p>

<p>Attending these daily meditations has slowly changed my life habits. Directly, I feel less anxious and stressful, I feel that Iâ€™m able to focus more on the present. Indirectly, I think itâ€™s really influenced me to change small things in my life or to try new things which have impacted my life in a positive way, like being open to exercising! Hopefully itâ€™s something I can keep up :)</p>
