I certainly have, but have always been daunted by expensive churning machines or complicated recipes. This sorbet recipe provides a simple and unique tasting alternative. You won’t have tasted anything like it before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the best things about it is that it’s the perfect pantry recipe, containing only a handful of ingredients (that you may already have).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you’ll need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2 cans of coconut milk 
400ml of honey 
Limes 
Sea Salt&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How to make:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Using a blender or food processor, give the coconut milk and honey a quick whiz. Mix in sea salt and the juice of one lime. Pour into a plastic tub and put in the freezer. Every hour or so take a fork and give the sorbet a good mix, scraping through any ice crystals that form. It’s best to do this over the course of 3-4 hours and then leave overnight until solid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Garnish as much lime zest and sea salt as you like.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s really that simple.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Eoin</name></author><summary type="html">ever wanted to make your own ice cream?

What is a brain dump? This is something completely inspired by The Artist’s Way. I’ve always liked the idea of journalling to keep a log of your thoughts, goals, and dreams so they’re no longer just thoughts floating about in your head. Writing things down makes them real, and the more real they are, the more likely I am to act on them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think it’s mostly because writing them down in a way feels like a commitment device. This isn’t always the case - sometimes you write things down just because you want to get them out of your head and you don’t want to forget things. But when it comes to goals and dreams and all that kind of stuff, I think writing them down - and the more specific the better - feels like you’re making a commitment to yourself, and you’re more likely to stick to it as a result.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s not what this post is really about. The purpose of this big brain dump is just to write down whatever you’re thinking of - it can be as silly or as heavy as you’d like it to be. The idea is just to declutter your brain, and this is one of the main tools that Julia Cameron, the author of The Artist’s Way, swears by. To get to the other side, you have to break the barrier that is often self-made, intentionally or unintentionally.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;She calls it longhand, stream-of-consciousness morning writing, and you’re not supposed to reread it for a while. You can have check-ins every now and then, to give you a journal to your creative journey. I don’t know, I’m just very intrigued. I feel like I’ve written about this so many times now, but I’ll do it again one more time. Just in case.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I first heard about this from Tim Ferriss’s podcast with Elizabeth Gilbert. On the podcast, she talked about how her morning pages led to a discovery that she wanted to learn Italian, something that she’d never known about herself before. It just revealed itself in her morning brain dumps. And it led to a big around-the-world self-discovery journey. That’s how Eat, Pray, Love came about.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s what really piqued my interest. We think we know ourselves, but how well? How often do we have thoughts that barely make it to our consciousness, that we miss them? Also I’d like to think that getting out silly, sometimes unnecessary thoughts first thing in the morning might help me organise my thoughts a lot better during the day. And if it works for Elizabeth Gilbert and so many others, think there’s a pretty high probability that it would work for me too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know, I’m going to give it a go and see what it does to my brain. Have a go, you might find it helpful too!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jess</name></author><summary type="html">do a big what? What is a brain dump? This is something completely inspired by The Artist’s Way.

&lt;br /&gt;
Went for a walk to the park early morning and bumped into my year 7 maths teacher and her dog. Had a nice chat, then came back to speak to a friend on Zoom, before having two bacon and egg bagels for lunch. Then went for a long walk in the forest, bought some haribo and a pot noodle as a throwback to being a 12 year old kid, ate them outside in the garden, followed by a hot bath.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you think about something or someone you hadn’t in a while?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Everything I used to do as a kid on summer holidays around this area - including my paper round and the man who ran it. He looked (looks?) suspiciously like Fagin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you have a meaningful interaction with someone?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
My old maths teacher - was sad to hear that unfortunately she’s got cancer, but is still running (which is her favourite sport) and was great to see how excited she was to see what I was up to now. Also funny she didn’t recognise me at all despite the fact I probably haven’t grown since then either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did anything interesting happen?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Got sent these journal prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you learn something new about yourself?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I love fresh turmeric - gives me loads of energy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about lockdown today?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I felt good. It’s been quite chilled compared to normal London life, but would like to see friends properly!&lt;/p&gt;

I am so lazy). It’s mostly my inner bitch talking whenever I’m feeling like this. But once you’re doing it, it can be really nice and even feel meditative.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think what’s really interesting about this whole pandemic situation (I think I managed to avoid using the word pandemic up until this point!) is that we now really appreciate the ability to go out and be free to move. And one thing that I’ve found useful whenever I’m feeling a little down, or stressed out, is just to go for a little wander. Though again, this is always tricky because whenever I’m feeling like that I almost always instantly just want to curl up into a little ball and just do nothing - even though I know that every time I manage to get my ass out the door I always feel better. It’s quite helpful to leave whatever stressful situation you’re in and have a bit of fresh air.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I went for a little wander yesterday, in search for this monument that commemorates the guy who translated the Bible from Greek into English. I think you’d normally be able to go up to the top but obviously because social distancing is in place, we weren’t able to do that. It was situated on top of this hill, at the Cotswold edge, and the view was absolutely spectacular. You can see Wales from the top of this hill, which is quite something.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It kind of makes you think about how small you are - in a good way. I think these are the things that help you put stuff into perspective. This was the extent of my pondering/reflecting though, because apparently I get quite grumpy when I’m hungry &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; cold, so after about 5-10 minutes of ooh-ing and aah-ing, and some pictures, we turned around and headed back (to the kitchen).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As part of your daily exercise, why not go for a long walk and just…….take in the view, wherever you are. Maybe even leave that rectangle electronic thing behind. You know what I’m talking about, the one that lights up when you touch and tap 😉&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jess</name></author><summary type="html">as enjoyable as going for a long walk is, I must admit, I can sometimes be quite resistant to the idea of moving (typical.

&lt;br /&gt;
Today is a work day. I’ve been brought back from furlough, and we’re now doing 4 days a week. It’s been nice so far, we have a mix of busy days and not-so-busy days. I’d say it’s a good balance. There’s been lots of staring at the screen today, and preparing for a presentation. Also tried to do a bit of writing and journalling (to officially launch this lockdown journal project!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Artist’s Way arrived. If you’re not sure what that is, check out my latest newsletter here. As the geek and weirdo that I am, I got super excited by the smell of the book and the feel of the paper (told you, weird). But most importantly, can’t wait to start reading the book and be like Elizabeth Gilbert. Maybe I’ll  be inspired enough to write a book after I finish reading this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you think about something or someone you hadn’t in a while?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I thought about my parents (not that I hadn’t thought about them in a while! Promise I do think about them hehehe) The theme of this morning’s meeting was on happiness and who’s made you happy during quarantine. I thought about my parents and the videos they’ve been sending - of my dad shaving his head. Cute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you have a meaningful interaction with someone (or was it just meaningless zoom faff)?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A great quiz planning session. Excited about hosting the quiz on Thursday, but not going to lie, these quizzes are relentless. Also made a thank you card that put a smile on the recipient’s face (I think? I hope it wasn’t a fake or forced smile 😛).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did anything interesting happen?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Artist’s Way arrived! I know I’ve mentioned it in one of the questions, but it just looks so fresh and shiny (and the pages smell so good, I can’t help it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you learn something new about yourself?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That I am a freak. Why do I love smelling books so much?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about lockdown today?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Okay I think. I’m not sure, really. Had a conversation about what my plans are for the coming month. It’s May already, and I can’t really predict what’s going to happen. It has made me realise how resilient we are as a species because now lockdown kind of feels like the new normal, which is why I’m having trouble imagining what life after lockdown is going to be like. But at the same time, it also makes you think that based on how (relatively) quickly we adjusted to this situation, it’s very likely that we might also readjust fairly quickly to life post-lockdown, and move on and perhaps even forget about everything that we learned during this lockdown?&lt;/p&gt;

Something about being stuck at home I believe.. makes you explore every inch and corner of your house and discover new ways to stay busy and entertained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other night, having just come back from a run (how cool is it that I can say this now?! I feel like I’ve levelled up or something), naturally I was starving. The original plan was to make this quick lemon pepper chicken recipe - which has been tried and tested. But alas, there was no chicken in the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did involve some frantic dig down the internet hole to figure out what to cook for dinner. I needed something tasty, something quick, and something which didn’t involve too many complicated ingredients. It was a battle between chickpeas or lentils.. but in the end, lentils won out. Mostly because the recipe I was using had eggs in it, and that we didn’t have enough chickpeas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I based it on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.olivemagazine.com/recipes/vegetarian/spiced-crispy-egg-and-lentil-curry/&quot;&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;. It ticked all the boxes, except for the ‘quick’ one. Definitely wasn’t the quickest to make - it took 30 minutes just to let the curry simmer. I’d say it took about an hour total - but it was so worth it. Very tasty, and not a lot of complicated ingredients involved!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;red lentils 100g&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;onions 2, roughly chopped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;chopped tomatoes 400g tin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ground turmeric 1 tsp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;oil 2 tbsp, for frying&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ground cumin 1 ½ tsp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ground coriander 1 ½ tsp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cardamom pods 4, squashed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;root ginger a thumb-sized piece, finely chopped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;garlic 4 cloves, crushed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;green chillies 2-3, sliced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;baby spinach 100g, chopped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;garam masala 1 tsp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coriander a small bunch, chopped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;steamed basmati rice or chapatis to serve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the crispy eggs you’ll need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;eggs 6&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ground turmeric ¼ tsp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;paprika ¼ tsp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to do it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the lentils, onions and tomatoes in a pan with the turmeric and 1 tsp salt. Add water to just cover, then simmer gently for 20 minutes until the lentils are tender&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drop the eggs into boiling water, cook for 7 minutes then plunge into iced water and leave until cooled.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heat half the oil in a pan then stir in the cumin, coriander and cardamom. Cook for 2 minutes then stir in the ginger, garlic and chillies. Cook for a few minutes then add the lentil mixture and 100ml water. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Add the spinach and cook for another 10 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Peel the eggs and heat the remaining oil in a frying pan. Add the eggs, turmeric and paprika, then season with salt and cook until the skin starts to blister and crisp up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stir the garam masala and coriander into the curry and serve with the halved eggs and rice or chapatis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t have coriander unfortunately, but I think it would have tasted spectacular with coriander.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you’re looking for an easy recipe, have a go at this and let me know how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck 😊&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jess</name></author><summary type="html">so like I mentioned in the previous post, I’ve been trying to experiment a little bit in the kitchen.

Not when you’re a kid, I suppose. I have so many fond memories of playing Checkers, Monopoly, and Scrabble as a kid. An important side note here though, is that smartphones weren’t really a thing when I was growing up, so distractions like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok didn’t exist (not that I’m on TikTok now, I’m not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; cool).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One nice thing about the lockdown is that as we all rack our brains to find new ways to keep ourselves entertained, lots of things that seem to be a distant memory are now resurfacing. (Also, who else is finding themselves experimenting a bit more in the kitchen? I made a lentil curry the other night and I must say, I was very proud of the result).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think back to your childhood, what were the things you used to do to keep you busy? I remember many evenings of playing board games. I gotta say though, my family wasn’t the most adventurous when it comes to board games. Or is my memory failing me? The ones that stick out the most are Monopoly, Scrabble, and Checkers. So I definitely did not know how to play Backgammon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, until a few nights ago! Oh yes, how exciting. Instead of a normal dinner then TV or dinner then chat routine, this night we opted for… a backgammon session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was difficult. It was so much trickier than it looked! I mean I did still win the first game 😏 Hahaha jokes - I only won because I was basically told what moves to make, and for some reason, the dice seemed to be on my side. Not as much luck the second time around, I’m afraid - proof to you that it was all due to a) beginner’s luck, and b) external help. But hey, at least now I know how to play Backgammon! Kind of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe for today’s idea, we can try play some board games! The internet is fun and all, but I guess it can be good to take an hour or so off the internet and have an offline entertainment. Go back to your childhood, and explore those things you used to love doing as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure a little reminiscing won’t hurt! ☺️&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jess</name></author><summary type="html">board games are so underrated. Not when you’re a kid, I suppose.

&lt;p&gt;But never mind! Who says you have to be naturally gifted to paint. Honestly, I thought it would just really fun to just play with colours, splatter some acrylic paint around. So that’s exactly what I did. One thing about this though - art supplies are not exactly cheap. Things do add up: brushes, acrylic paint, canvas.. Luckily, we already had brushes and acrylic paint in the house. No canvas though, so we decided to make do with wood. Wood? Yes. Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marchemeon.com/&quot;&gt;Marc Hemeon&lt;/a&gt; and his beautiful paintings, I picked up some wood that just happened to be there lying around… and painted on it. And it worked! It had a nice smooth surface, so it was relatively easy to work with. I spent the next hour or so making a complete mess and having lots of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but sometimes painting, drawing, and all these’ artsy’ things can be quite daunting especially if you’re new to it, and you’re not naturally gifted. But I think this is the perfect time to just experiment. The aim is not to impress anyone, it’s just to have fun and have a creative outlet. Some of you might find it helpful, especially during this weird situation where many of us might have a lot of pent-up frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today’s idea isn’t super complicated. Grab some paints, brushes, and some type of flat surface, and paint away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have fun 😊&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jess</name></author><summary type="html">i wasn’t sure how this one would turn out.

I have always been intrigued by coding and the tech world.  It feel very relevant too to the field I’m in, which is (behavioural) design - &lt;em&gt;I sense a post coming on what behavioural design is!&lt;/em&gt; I feel like in the direction that we’re heading in, it seems inevitable that technology will take over pretty much most things in our lives. So I guess instead of resisting it, might as well try to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took my first baby step last year when I decided to buy an online web development course. It was very basic yet very helpful. It gave me the foundation I needed to work with. But as I’m sure you know, the way to learn things is by doing. And unfortunately, I didn’t have any real project to work on. Everything I did was based off instructions given in the lectures, and as a result I wasn’t really able to have a deeper understanding of how things worked. Not that I have a deep understanding of it now 😅, but I suppose I can say that I’m more confident about it now than I was about a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then life got busy and I slowly lost all my willpower to continue practicing to code. All kinds of excuses were made. It was easy to say “I’m tired, I have no time”. But now I feel like that doesn’t apply anymore. When you’re locked in the house and not allowed to go out, and all you have is time, I suppose it’s the perfect time to do everything you’ve always wanted to do. So I decided to do just that - give myself a project. Build a website! How? Learn to code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know that we have all these amazing platforms like Squarespace, Wix, and Weebly that help us create beautiful websites without having to know the first thing about coding. My &lt;a href=&quot;www.jessmessdesign.com&quot;&gt;Jess’ Mess&lt;/a&gt; website is built on Squarespace. It’s great! But I did want to challenge myself because, after all, I had to find a way to kill time (and not kill myself as a result of boredom).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is the end-product! If you wondered why this website was so simple and basic, well.. I guess this answers your question. I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to make it very basic and simple because I’m a complete novice. But it’s so satisfying to see the site up and running!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re also wanting to learn to code, here are some good sources you might find useful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codecademy.com/&quot;&gt;Codeacademy&lt;/a&gt; - they are actually giving away free premium memberships for people who have been directly impacted by the Coronavirus e.g. people on furlough. I did this briefly after I did my first web development course.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.killervideostore.com/&quot;&gt;Stefan Mischook’s online course&lt;/a&gt; - this is the course I did. I enjoyed doing this course, and at the end of every chapter he has a quiz to make sure you understand the concepts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/search?query=coding&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt; - they also have some free courses on basic coding languages, in partnership with and delivered by top universities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is something you’ve always wanted to do, why not do it now? These three sources are a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

If anything, it feels like sometimes we forget to actually take a second to enjoy where we are, what we’re doing, and who we’re with. But I do wonder if that’s actually due to our obsession of impressing others, rather than a healthy desire to remember moments dear to our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I don’t mean to sound all philosophical (and pretentious). I think my point is simply that I often take pictures because I subconsciously think about impressing other people and getting ‘likes’. When really, if I really think about it, the beauty of taking pictures is the act of documenting moments that you’ll want to remember 10, 20, 50 years from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read my Write a Journal entry, then you’ll know where I’m going with this. This isn’t the best moment in the history of humankind, but there is definitely a lot to learn from this period. A lot of us, if not all of us, have found ourselves in unfamiliar situations. How we’re adapting to this hasn’t ceased to amaze me. Is this the new normal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we are adaptable creatures, then it probably means when all of this is over, we’ll probably forget the intricate details of our experiences during this lockdown. And if we forget, then how do we share what we learned from this to the future generation? Or, if that sounds too pretentious (again), we can at least use these pictures just to remember our past self, and how we dealt with weird things and uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been taking more pictures since the lockdown. Silly ones, though. Not highly crafted images. But pictures of me, and the people I’m with, going about our days. Sometimes doing silly things, sometimes just doing normal daily activities. The key, though, is to capture raw moments so in the future, we can have something to look back on, and maybe have a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jess</name></author><summary type="html">in the age of selfies and Instagram, and high-resolution cameras on our phones, taking pictures doesn’t sound like an activity we need reminding of.
