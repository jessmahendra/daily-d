&lt;br /&gt;
Today is a work day. I’ve been brought back from furlough, and we’re now doing 4 days a week. It’s been nice so far, we have a mix of busy days and not-so-busy days. I’d say it’s a good balance. There’s been lots of staring at the screen today, and preparing for a presentation. Also tried to do a bit of writing and journalling (to officially launch this lockdown journal project!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Artist’s Way arrived. If you’re not sure what that is, check out my latest newsletter here. As the geek and weirdo that I am, I got super excited by the smell of the book and the feel of the paper (told you, weird). But most importantly, can’t wait to start reading the book and be like Elizabeth Gilbert. Maybe I’ll  be inspired enough to write a book after I finish reading this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you think about something or someone you hadn’t in a while?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I thought about my parents (not that I hadn’t thought about them in a while! Promise I do think about them hehehe) The theme of this morning’s meeting was on happiness and who’s made you happy during quarantine. I thought about my parents and the videos they’ve been sending - of my dad shaving his head. Cute.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you have a meaningful interaction with someone (or was it just meaningless zoom faff)?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A great quiz planning session. Excited about hosting the quiz on Thursday, but not going to lie, these quizzes are relentless. Also made a thank you card that put a smile on the recipient’s face (I think? I hope it wasn’t a fake or forced smile 😛).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did anything interesting happen?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The Artist’s Way arrived! I know I’ve mentioned it in one of the questions, but it just looks so fresh and shiny (and the pages smell so good, I can’t help it).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Did you learn something new about yourself?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
That I am a freak. Why do I love smelling books so much?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you feel about lockdown today?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Okay I think. I’m not sure, really. Had a conversation about what my plans are for the coming month. It’s May already, and I can’t really predict what’s going to happen. It has made me realise how resilient we are as a species because now lockdown kind of feels like the new normal, which is why I’m having trouble imagining what life after lockdown is going to be like. But at the same time, it also makes you think that based on how (relatively) quickly we adjusted to this situation, it’s very likely that we might also readjust fairly quickly to life post-lockdown, and move on and perhaps even forget about everything that we learned during this lockdown?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Additional comments?&lt;/strong&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
I made honey/water ice cubes today. Not sure if it’s going to work, will report back.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jess</name></author><summary type="html">what did you do today?

Something about being stuck at home I believe.. makes you explore every inch and corner of your house and discover new ways to stay busy and entertained.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other night, having just come back from a run (how cool is it that I can say this now?! I feel like I’ve levelled up or something), naturally I was starving. The original plan was to make this quick lemon pepper chicken recipe - which has been tried and tested. But alas, there was no chicken in the fridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It did involve some frantic dig down the internet hole to figure out what to cook for dinner. I needed something tasty, something quick, and something which didn’t involve too many complicated ingredients. It was a battle between chickpeas or lentils.. but in the end, lentils won out. Mostly because the recipe I was using had eggs in it, and that we didn’t have enough chickpeas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I based it on this &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.olivemagazine.com/recipes/vegetarian/spiced-crispy-egg-and-lentil-curry/&quot;&gt;recipe&lt;/a&gt;. It ticked all the boxes, except for the ‘quick’ one. Definitely wasn’t the quickest to make - it took 30 minutes just to let the curry simmer. I’d say it took about an hour total - but it was so worth it. Very tasty, and not a lot of complicated ingredients involved!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s what you need:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Curry:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;red lentils 100g&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;onions 2, roughly chopped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;chopped tomatoes 400g tin&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ground turmeric 1 tsp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;oil 2 tbsp, for frying&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ground cumin 1 ½ tsp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ground coriander 1 ½ tsp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;cardamom pods 4, squashed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;root ginger a thumb-sized piece, finely chopped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;garlic 4 cloves, crushed&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;green chillies 2-3, sliced&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;baby spinach 100g, chopped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;garam masala 1 tsp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;coriander a small bunch, chopped&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;steamed basmati rice or chapatis to serve&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the crispy eggs you’ll need:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;eggs 6&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;ground turmeric ¼ tsp&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;paprika ¼ tsp&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here’s how to do it:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put the lentils, onions and tomatoes in a pan with the turmeric and 1 tsp salt. Add water to just cover, then simmer gently for 20 minutes until the lentils are tender&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Drop the eggs into boiling water, cook for 7 minutes then plunge into iced water and leave until cooled.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Heat half the oil in a pan then stir in the cumin, coriander and cardamom. Cook for 2 minutes then stir in the ginger, garlic and chillies. Cook for a few minutes then add the lentil mixture and 100ml water. Cover and simmer for 30 minutes. Add the spinach and cook for another 10 minutes.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Peel the eggs and heat the remaining oil in a frying pan. Add the eggs, turmeric and paprika, then season with salt and cook until the skin starts to blister and crisp up.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stir the garam masala and coriander into the curry and serve with the halved eggs and rice or chapatis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We didn’t have coriander unfortunately, but I think it would have tasted spectacular with coriander.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So if you’re looking for an easy recipe, have a go at this and let me know how it goes!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck 😊&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jess</name></author><summary type="html">so like I mentioned in the previous post, I’ve been trying to experiment a little bit in the kitchen.

Not when you’re a kid, I suppose. I have so many fond memories of playing Checkers, Monopoly, and Scrabble as a kid. An important side note here though, is that smartphones weren’t really a thing when I was growing up, so distractions like Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok didn’t exist (not that I’m on TikTok now, I’m not &lt;em&gt;that&lt;/em&gt; cool).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One nice thing about the lockdown is that as we all rack our brains to find new ways to keep ourselves entertained, lots of things that seem to be a distant memory are now resurfacing. (Also, who else is finding themselves experimenting a bit more in the kitchen? I made a lentil curry the other night and I must say, I was very proud of the result).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you think back to your childhood, what were the things you used to do to keep you busy? I remember many evenings of playing board games. I gotta say though, my family wasn’t the most adventurous when it comes to board games. Or is my memory failing me? The ones that stick out the most are Monopoly, Scrabble, and Checkers. So I definitely did not know how to play Backgammon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That is, until a few nights ago! Oh yes, how exciting. Instead of a normal dinner then TV or dinner then chat routine, this night we opted for… a backgammon session.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was difficult. It was so much trickier than it looked! I mean I did still win the first game 😏 Hahaha jokes - I only won because I was basically told what moves to make, and for some reason, the dice seemed to be on my side. Not as much luck the second time around, I’m afraid - proof to you that it was all due to a) beginner’s luck, and b) external help. But hey, at least now I know how to play Backgammon! Kind of.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe for today’s idea, we can try play some board games! The internet is fun and all, but I guess it can be good to take an hour or so off the internet and have an offline entertainment. Go back to your childhood, and explore those things you used to love doing as a kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m sure a little reminiscing won’t hurt! ☺️&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jess</name></author><summary type="html">board games are so underrated. Not when you’re a kid, I suppose.

I am not a painter, not the most naturally artistic person in the world. When it comes to art, the best thing I got going for me is probably calligraphy/lettering - even then I’m not exactly good at drawing letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But never mind! Who says you have to be naturally gifted to paint. Honestly, I thought it would just really fun to just play with colours, splatter some acrylic paint around. So that’s exactly what I did. One thing about this though - art supplies are not exactly cheap. Things do add up: brushes, acrylic paint, canvas.. Luckily, we already had brushes and acrylic paint in the house. No canvas though, so we decided to make do with wood. Wood? Yes. Inspired by &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.marchemeon.com/&quot;&gt;Marc Hemeon&lt;/a&gt; and his beautiful paintings, I picked up some wood that just happened to be there lying around… and painted on it. And it worked! It had a nice smooth surface, so it was relatively easy to work with. I spent the next hour or so making a complete mess and having lots of fun.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/ocean.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Smiley face&quot; height=&quot;100%&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I don’t know about you, but sometimes painting, drawing, and all these’ artsy’ things can be quite daunting especially if you’re new to it, and you’re not naturally gifted. But I think this is the perfect time to just experiment. The aim is not to impress anyone, it’s just to have fun and have a creative outlet. Some of you might find it helpful, especially during this weird situation where many of us might have a lot of pent-up frustration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So today’s idea isn’t super complicated. Grab some paints, brushes, and some type of flat surface, and paint away!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have fun 😊&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jess</name></author><summary type="html">i wasn’t sure how this one would turn out.

I have always been intrigued by coding and the tech world.  It feel very relevant too to the field I’m in, which is (behavioural) design - &lt;em&gt;I sense a post coming on what behavioural design is!&lt;/em&gt; I feel like in the direction that we’re heading in, it seems inevitable that technology will take over pretty much most things in our lives. So I guess instead of resisting it, might as well try to understand it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I took my first baby step last year when I decided to buy an online web development course. It was very basic yet very helpful. It gave me the foundation I needed to work with. But as I’m sure you know, the way to learn things is by doing. And unfortunately, I didn’t have any real project to work on. Everything I did was based off instructions given in the lectures, and as a result I wasn’t really able to have a deeper understanding of how things worked. Not that I have a deep understanding of it now 😅, but I suppose I can say that I’m more confident about it now than I was about a year ago.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And then life got busy and I slowly lost all my willpower to continue practicing to code. All kinds of excuses were made. It was easy to say “I’m tired, I have no time”. But now I feel like that doesn’t apply anymore. When you’re locked in the house and not allowed to go out, and all you have is time, I suppose it’s the perfect time to do everything you’ve always wanted to do. So I decided to do just that - give myself a project. Build a website! How? Learn to code.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, I know that we have all these amazing platforms like Squarespace, Wix, and Weebly that help us create beautiful websites without having to know the first thing about coding. My &lt;a href=&quot;www.jessmessdesign.com&quot;&gt;Jess’ Mess&lt;/a&gt; website is built on Squarespace. It’s great! But I did want to challenge myself because, after all, I had to find a way to kill time (and not kill myself as a result of boredom).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So here is the end-product! If you wondered why this website was so simple and basic, well.. I guess this answers your question. I &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to make it very basic and simple because I’m a complete novice. But it’s so satisfying to see the site up and running!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you’re also wanting to learn to code, here are some good sources you might find useful:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.codecademy.com/&quot;&gt;Codeacademy&lt;/a&gt; - they are actually giving away free premium memberships for people who have been directly impacted by the Coronavirus e.g. people on furlough. I did this briefly after I did my first web development course.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.killervideostore.com/&quot;&gt;Stefan Mischook’s online course&lt;/a&gt; - this is the course I did. I enjoyed doing this course, and at the end of every chapter he has a quiz to make sure you understand the concepts.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.coursera.org/search?query=coding&amp;amp;&quot;&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt; - they also have some free courses on basic coding languages, in partnership with and delivered by top universities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If this is something you’ve always wanted to do, why not do it now? These three sources are a great place to start.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Good luck!&lt;/p&gt;

If anything, it feels like sometimes we forget to actually take a second to enjoy where we are, what we’re doing, and who we’re with. But I do wonder if that’s actually due to our obsession of impressing others, rather than a healthy desire to remember moments dear to our hearts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry, I don’t mean to sound all philosophical (and pretentious). I think my point is simply that I often take pictures because I subconsciously think about impressing other people and getting ‘likes’. When really, if I really think about it, the beauty of taking pictures is the act of documenting moments that you’ll want to remember 10, 20, 50 years from now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you read my Write a Journal entry, then you’ll know where I’m going with this. This isn’t the best moment in the history of humankind, but there is definitely a lot to learn from this period. A lot of us, if not all of us, have found ourselves in unfamiliar situations. How we’re adapting to this hasn’t ceased to amaze me. Is this the new normal?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But if we are adaptable creatures, then it probably means when all of this is over, we’ll probably forget the intricate details of our experiences during this lockdown. And if we forget, then how do we share what we learned from this to the future generation? Or, if that sounds too pretentious (again), we can at least use these pictures just to remember our past self, and how we dealt with weird things and uncertainties.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been taking more pictures since the lockdown. Silly ones, though. Not highly crafted images. But pictures of me, and the people I’m with, going about our days. Sometimes doing silly things, sometimes just doing normal daily activities. The key, though, is to capture raw moments so in the future, we can have something to look back on, and maybe have a laugh.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Have fun!&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jess</name></author><summary type="html">in the age of selfies and Instagram, and high-resolution cameras on our phones, taking pictures doesn’t sound like an activity we need reminding of.

&lt;p&gt;If I think about the lockdown too much, my head starts to hurt and freak out about not knowing when all this will end. So I find that it’s best to distract myself by keeping busy and staying active. If you’ve read my second newsletter then you’ll know that I’ve decided to make running a regular thing in my life (if you’re not subscribed and don’t know what I’m talking about, you can read that &lt;a href=&quot;https://mailchi.mp/f8ad3e47f422/newsletter-2-i-went-for-a-run&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. You can sign up for the newsletter below for some reading materials for when you’re bored and have nothing better to do). That’s exactly what I did last Saturday, I went for a run.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t say that I enjoyed every single second of that run, but I do have to admit that the post-run feeling was great. I was pretty proud of myself for having completed the first task of the Couch to 5K programme, and maybe it was a combination of that and the warm weather, and &lt;a href=&quot;https://open.spotify.com/track/47w6S27JF4Zvrz1Wd6R66Z?si=LBy15BVbTh-yQ4fhkYTI5g&quot;&gt;the song I was listening to&lt;/a&gt;, but I kind of felt this weird need to just start dancing around in the middle of nowhere (where nobody could see me, because I still have a sense of pride).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I did. Then I realised how much I’d missed dancing. I used to dance quite a bit when I was younger. It was fun. And then I’m not sure what happened - I guess life took over. But the need to move never left. I think this is why I’m so drawn to yoga - moving your body fluidly sends you into a trance. No thoughts, just movement. It feels so liberating, especially at a time where we’re constantly reminded of the confusing state of the world, which can cause a lot of anxiety. I think what made it more fun, though, is doing it outside. All the space and the sunshine, having an entire road all to yourself, it feels so good. It feels like complete freedom amidst all the restrictions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dancing outside might be a bit of a stretch to a lot of you, but maybe just put on some good music, and dance your heart out in your bedroom. See how that makes you feel 😊&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jess</name></author><summary type="html">one good thing about being in lockdown is that you can go for a run and dance outside (for a good while) before you see another person.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="http://localhost:4000/dance.png" /><media:content medium="image" url="http://localhost:4000/dance.png" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Write a Journal</title><link href="http://localhost:4000/life/2020/04/28/write-a-journal.html" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Write a Journal" /><published>2020-04-28T09:00:00+01:00</published><updated>2020-04-28T09:00:00+01:00</updated><id>http://localhost:4000/life/2020/04/28/write-a-journal</id><content type="html" xml:base="http://localhost:4000/life/2020/04/28/write-a-journal.html">&lt;p&gt;it’s been just over a month now since the government told us to stay at home. I don’t know about you, but I find it quite hard to find the perfect word to describe the sentiment of this situation, and to describe how I feel about it all. It feels like everything happened so suddenly, and escalated so quickly. The whole thing is so unprecedented that I feel I lack the framework to comprehend what’s going on now and what will happen next.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Being in lockdown and isolated is not completely new to humankind, I suppose, but how often does it really happen? And how crazy has this year been? I’m not here to talk statistics, I’m just trying to make sense of everything, perhaps like you are too - of how strange everything has been, but how at the same time, we as a species have shown how resilient and adaptable we are. And again, how often does this happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frank Chimero wrote &lt;a href=&quot;https://frankchimero.com/blog/2020/today-today-today/&quot;&gt;a nice piece about being in an incubation period&lt;/a&gt; and how “being in the incubator denies you your life for a time but can give back a different perspective”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The days seem to go by really fast, and maybe it’s because I’m trying my best to keep busy and find new things to do (things that I suppose I would not normally do), or maybe it’s because I can’t help but try to create, and settle into a new routine. But this feels like a significant, defining period, and that as much as I hate that this is happening and affecting so many people, it’s also something that I don’t want to forget, because we have so much to learn from this. Just like what Frank said, this is the moment that can give us a different perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So for today’s idea, I propose that we all write a journal. Maybe it doesn’t have to be everyday, but I think it would be nice to record this period of our lives, so we can remember this period, and remember how it made us feel. How it made us more appreciative of the things we used to take for granted, more appreciative of the healthcare workers, and of all the key workers. How it made us remember to check in on our friends and family, to take care of each other, and to connect with each other. Because we adapt, and when things get better and we’re out of lockdown, I’d hate to think that we’d all just revert back to our old ways of living and forget about this new perspective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So maybe, if we write a journal and record this period of our lives, it can help us be more grateful later?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a thought :)&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Jess</name></author><summary type="html">it’s been just over a month now since the government told us to stay at home.

I’m someone who has always enjoyed listening to the radio. Hearing stories and conversations on the radio has always felt like a treat - getting to know how other people think, talk, and see the world. Not just that though. There’s something about voices that I find just so relaxing and soothing (some more than others, perhaps. My top two favourite voices: &lt;a href=&quot;https://99percentinvisible.org/&quot;&gt;Roman Mars&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&quot;https://onbeing.org/&quot;&gt;Krista Tippett&lt;/a&gt;. You’re welcome).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think most of the time I gravitate towards interview/conversation-type podcasts. It’s always nice to also listen to an interview with someone you don’t know, because you almost always end up learning something new, and you also get to discover new people, with unique interests you might not be exposed to otherwise. It gives you different perspectives, I guess. Then you also have podcasts with narratives and a storytelling feel, that immerse you into someone else’s life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The absence of work commute and travel as a result of the lockdown has kind of reduced my podcast consumption, because this was what I had my ears in during work commute and travels. Now that I’m not doing that anymore, I realise I haven’t been listening to podcasts as much. So for today’s daily diversion idea, I thought this would be a nice one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I love finding out new interesting podcasts, so thought you might enjoy a list of interesting podcasts too.&lt;/p&gt;

Being able to stand on your head, or your arms, or your hands, kind of makes you feel like you can do anything. The kind of feeling you might gravitate towards during times of uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of research showing that exercising is good not just for your physical health, but also for your mental health. When we exercise, our body produces endorphins that trigger a positive feeling in the body. No wonder we always feel good after an exercise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What makes it even better though, is that if you stick with it and stay disciplined, you’ll start to see improvements and feel so much stronger. I think this is one of the reasons why I love starting the day with a yoga practice. When you start off the day feeling strong, it just gives you the feeling that you can handle whatever life is going to throw at you that day. Okay maybe not that dramatic, but you know what I mean. You just feel a lot more confident than you would otherwise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now that everything feels so uncertain and we don’t really know what is going to happen even in the next few days, I find that focusing on taking back control through physical exercise has been massively helpful. Being on furlough has the effect of making days feel unstructured, so sticking to a routine and giving yourself a project help a lot. So, in the physical fitness department, my project/goal for this lockdown is learn to do a handstand. It’s definitely going to take years to perfect, but I think right now I’d be happy to be able to kick up to a handstand and hold for (at least!) a second.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Practicing Ashtanga yoga has helped a lot in terms of building an upper body strength, but supplementing it with other forms of exercise will accelerate your progress for sure. I’ve been working on arms and shoulders more, and have definitely felt a difference. Core is key too though, something which I haven’t really paid that much attention to.&lt;/p&gt;
