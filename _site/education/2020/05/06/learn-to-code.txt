    <article>
      today's daily diversion is actually what brought this website to life! I have always been intrigued by coding and the tech world.  It feel very relevant too to the field I'm in, which is (behavioural) design - *I sense a post coming on what behavioural design is!* I feel like in the direction that we're heading in, it seems inevitable that technology will take over pretty much most things in our lives. So I guess instead of resisting it, might as well try to understand it.

I took my first baby step last year when I decided to buy an online web development course. It was very basic yet very helpful. It gave me the foundation I needed to work with. But as I'm sure you know, the way to learn things is by doing. And unfortunately, I didn't have any real project to work on. Everything I did was based off instructions given in the lectures, and as a result I wasn't really able to have a deeper understanding of how things worked. Not that I have a deep understanding of it now üòÖ, but I suppose I can say that I'm more confident about it now than I was about a year ago.

And then life got busy and I slowly lost all my willpower to continue practicing to code. All kinds of excuses were made. It was easy to say "I'm tired, I have no time". But now I feel like that doesn't apply anymore. When you're locked in the house and not allowed to go out, and all you have is time, I suppose it's the perfect time to do everything you've always wanted to do. So I decided to do just that - give myself a project. Build a website! How? Learn to code.

Yes, I know that we have all these amazing platforms like Squarespace, Wix, and Weebly that help us create beautiful websites without having to know the first thing about coding. My [Jess' Mess](www.jessmessdesign.com) website is built on Squarespace. It's great! But I did want to challenge myself because, after all, I had to find a way to kill time (and not kill myself as a result of boredom).

So here is the end-product! If you wondered why this website was so simple and basic, well.. I guess this answers your question. I *had* to make it very basic and simple because I'm a complete novice. But it's so satisfying to see the site up and running!

If you're also wanting to learn to code, here are some good sources you might find useful:

1. [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/) - they are actually giving away free premium memberships for people who have been directly impacted by the Coronavirus e.g. people on furlough. I did this briefly after I did my first web development course.
2. [Stefan Mischook's online course](https://www.killervideostore.com/) - this is the course I did. I enjoyed doing this course, and at the end of every chapter he has a quiz to make sure you understand the concepts.
3. [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/search?query=coding&) - they also have some free courses on basic coding languages, in partnership with and delivered by top universities.

If this is something you've always wanted to do, why not do it now? These three sources are a great place to start.

Good luck!

P.S. Sharing ideas of things to do is fine and all, but do we actually follow through with them? Subscribe to my newsletter now to get updates on my personal experience and (some failed) attempts on actually doing the things I write about - and hear from other people about their experiences ‚ò∫Ô∏è
